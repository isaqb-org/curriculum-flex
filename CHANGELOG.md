# Release Notes

## 2024.1

### GOALS 
This is a preparation for an update of the curriculum. The goal is to have an updated curriculum that is state-of-the-art and training providers can rely on for ~2 years. The purpose of this release is to restructure the curriculum to define a core/MUST-have part and extension/COULD-have parts e.g. when it comes to connections to other advanced level curricula (see [the FLEX wiki](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-flex/wiki)).
